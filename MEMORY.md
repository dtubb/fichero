# Durable Lessons Learned / Decisions

*   **SSRF Security Pattern for Research Tools (2026-04-10):** Security audit of research tools (research.py) revealed critical SSRF vulnerabilities:
    - `follow_redirects=True` without redirect chain validation allows open redirect attacks
    - `_is_sandbox_violation()` using `startswith()` is insufficient — must validate resolved IPs
    - Must block RFC1918 ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x), loopback (127.x), link-local (169.254.x), cloud metadata
    - URL scheme checks are case-sensitive — need case-normalization
    - DNS rebinding requires resolution-time IP validation, not just hostname checks
    - Security tests should be written *before* fixes to document known vulnerabilities

*   **Agent Research Pattern**: Following the established pattern from knowledge_graph.py, hermeneutics.py, and mind_palace.py, the Agent Research implementation uses:
    - Pydantic models with `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True, extra="allow")`
    - Separate request/response models for API endpoints
    - Full CRUD with soft-delete (archiving) pattern
    - Status tracking with enums matching other modules
    - Placeholder tool implementations that return example data

*   **Skills Relocation:** Skills moved from `.agents/skills/` to `plugins/fs_session/skills/`. All script invocations now use `SCRIPT_ROOT` resolver that checks both `$HOME/.pi/agent/skills/fs_session/scripts` and repo `plugins/fs_session/skills/...`.

*   **Backend Task Prioritization (2026-04-10):** Created 21 backend-focused GitHub issues for milestones 0.0.3 through 0.1.0. All issues use only pre-configured labels (`area:backend-api`, `type:task`) since custom labels like `area:operations` don't exist in the project. Issues are properly organized by milestone and ready for AI agent claiming. Backend-only work available: #419-440 excluding Swift-requiring tasks.

*   **Branch Convention (2026-04-10):** Implementation work happens on milestone branches (e.g., `0.0.2`, `feature/388-hermeneutics`), not planning branches. The `0.0.2` branch IS the active implementation branch. State is now tracking backend implementation work for 0.0.3-0.1.0 milestones with 21 issues created for AI agent claiming.

*   **Migration Framework Pattern (2026-04-10):** Database migrations use a `MigrationRunner` class pattern:
    - Dry-run mode validates migrations without side effects (count-only)
    - All mutations logged to `MutationLog` with before/after state for rollback
    - Rollback operations reverse mutations in descending timestamp order (LIFO)
    - Batch processing with progress callbacks for large datasets
    - Validation safety checks prevent running unsafe migrations
    - Legacy function wrappers maintain backward compatibility
