# Overview

Slipbox leverages AI assistants running in a modular "LLM Lab" to help build a slipbox knowledge system from research material.

Key components of the LLM Lab:
- Lab Director Agent: Oversees workflow and assigns tasks to assistants
- Assistant Agents: Modular workers focused on particular tasks
- Validation Assistant: Reviews output quality and suggests improvements
Assistants

User provides sources
- Director assigns tasks to appropriate assistants
- Assistants execute assigned tasks and return output
- Validation assistant reviews output
- Director iterates if needed to improve quality
- Final output is returned to user

If the aim of the Slipbox  is to create a slipbox from research material, it does this leveraging AI assistants running in a modular "LLM Lab" to help build a slipbox knowledge system from research material. It uses AI Agents, running in the cloud or locally, accessed via LangChain. The workflow is as follows. First, the user points the Slipbox terminal application at a folder of documentsâ€”PDFs, JPGs (at present), and relartivly easily in the future DOCX, HTML, MD, CVS, EXCEL, and other files. From there, the Slipbox first step is to create a soruce folder, where it will store the original file, the metadata file, and an extract. Additional material, from AI covnersations, about this soruce, will be saved here, as well. Next, the SlipBox app will extract material from the original document. If this is a PDF, of a book, article, etc. the text is genrated, with pages numbers. If the document is a JPG, then the app will use Google Vision to extract the text from the document. From there, the document is passed to the Slipbox "LLM Lab" (sb\_llm\_lab). 

Each lab is modelled conceptually on idea of using Agents and Manbagers to solve a problem  [AgentVerse](https://github.com/openbmb/agentverse#task-solving-showcases). In this case, the SlipBox will ask the Lab to answer a question, for example to review the OCR of a text file. To do this task, the LLM Lab will create various "agents," that take this question, and then choose the next steps.

In this case, a *Lab Director* agent (sb\_llm\_slipbox\_lab\_director) will take the task. It will call on on a Extracted Text Assistabt to review  the the sources. the Lab Director agent will be tasked with u undertaking a task. For example, reviewing the text extracted from a soruce. It will oversea other AI agents, or research assistants, that can work with the source to do a specific task. For example, the first Director will as the Extracts Assistant to review the source text, and knows as much metadata as the slipbox can provide, and then make an educated guess on how to clean up the OCR.

The output will then be sent back to the the Director, whoe will know to send it to a Valaidator Assisant. 

The Validator Assistant will be tasked with reviewing the first Assistant's work. (Ineed, at each step, we'll use a Validator to review the previous assistants work. 

Once the validator is done, the Director will then reach out to a new Assistants whose task is to take the feedback from the validator, considers the first Assistants task, and then to integrate the required changes into the assistnat. This will be sent back to the director, validated one more time, and if it passed, the director will then send it out to an Assistant charged with formating the revised extracted text into the appropriate format for savings to the slipbox folder.

This is just one step. 

It works as follows. A sb_llm_lab_manager class that oversees the lab workflow. The A sb_lab class that initializes the lab environment. A sb_lab_director class that assigns tasks and directs the workflow. A sb_assistant base class that can be subclassed for different tasks

Two initial sb_assistant subclasses:

sb_llm_extracts_assistant - extracts key ideas/quotes from text

sb_llm_validator_assistant - reviews and validates previous output

The general workflow is:

- The user provides the lab with an input question or source text
- The lab director chooses which assistants are needed to process the input
- Assistants execute their tasks and return results
- The director validates the results and iterates if needed
- Final output is returned to the slipbox app to update the slipbox.

It has these assistants at its disposal.

- **Validation/Quality Control Assistant**: Will review the previous prompt and offer an evaluation, critique, suggestions, etc.

- **Extract Review Assistant**: Will review the provided text that is OCR and make suggestions.

# Workflow

1. Director assigns source material to agents
2. Extractor identifies key ideas 
3. Summarizer creates slip notes
4. Linker connects related slips
5. Tagger assigns topics to slips
6. Citer adds citation info  
7. Archiver stores sources

 
Next, the summarizer agent takes the extracts and condenses them into short slip notes - each expressing an atomic idea from the source. The slips are written in Markdown format.

The linker agent then makes connections between related slips, based on their concepts. It links slips on similar topics across sources.

The tagger agent assigns topic tags to each slip, categorizing their subject matter. This structures the emerging knowledge graph.

Meanwhile, the citer agent handles citations, linking slips back to their original sources.

The archiver agent manages the sources folder, ensuring originals are preserved.

Over time, new sources can be added, generating more slips and links. The assistants work together behind the scenes to incrementally build up a web of knowledge.

The professor and students can focus purely on their research, while the AI agents handle extracting ideas from the literature and organizing them into the networked slipbox.

Rather than traditional note taking, the AI assistance facilitates a slipbox knowledge base that can be continually expanded and improved as more sources are added. The modular assistants work 24/7 to build the knowledge graph.

Let me know if this helps explain at a high level how the slipbox lab could benefit professors and students without programming expertise! I'm happy to clarify or elaborate on any part.



# Key Classes
