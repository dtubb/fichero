Here is some more detail on how file management could work:

Storage Location:

- The slipbox data could be stored in a `data/` folder within the project. 

- This keeps it separate from code but accessible.

File Types:

- The main storage format would be Markdown files. 

- One .md file per slip, named by slip ID.

- Markdown supports links, formatting, headers, lists - good for notes.

- References could be stored as .bib BibTeX files. One per reference.

Folder Structure:

- `data/slips/` - Contains all slip Markdown files named `slip-###.md`

- `data/refs/` - Contains BibTeX reference files named `ref-###.bib` 

- `data/index/` - Any supplemental indices, category lists etc

File Management:

- SlipBoxManager handles all file IO. 

- It can create, read, update, delete files as needed to sync the file contents to in-memory objects.

- No direct file access from Slip/Reference classes - SlipBoxManager controllers file storage.

- On init, SlipBoxManager iterates through data folders, reads all files into objects.

- CRUD methods handle syncing memory state to files. 

- Allows managing slipbox purely in memory if desired.

This file/folder based approach allows persisting the entire slipbox as human-readable files that can be easily inspected, edited, backed up. But abstracts file handling into the manager class.
