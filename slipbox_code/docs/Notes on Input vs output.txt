You're right, it makes sense to separate the file handling for the input sources vs the internal slipbox storage.

Here is one way to divide it:

Input File Manager:

- Responsible for crawling folders and importing source material 

- Could be called something like `ImportFileManager`

- Located in `src/import` module

- Provides methods like:
  - crawlDirectory() - recursively walk folder structure
  - readFile() - read individual files like PDFs
  - extractText() - extract text from files
  - importFile() - save extracted text to an ImportFile model

- Imports raw content to build Slips from 

Slipbox File Manager: 

- Manages reading/writing slipbox data like Slips and References

- Located in `src/slipbox/io` module

- Provides methods like:
  - readSlipFiles() - parse slip Markdown files 
  - writeSlip() - serialize Slip to file

- Works with converted Slipbox data, not raw imports

So in summary:

- ImportFileManager handles crawling and ingesting raw source files 

- SlipboxFileManager handles serialized slipbox data

This separation makes sense as they deal with different types of data and workflows. The high level SlipBoxManager can leverage both - using the ImportFileManager to ingest new sources, and the SlipboxFileManager to load the existing knowledge base.

Let me know if this approach for dividing up the file management responsibilities makes sense!

Here is an expanded overview of the proposed InputFileManager class:

Purpose:

- The InputFileManager is responsible for discovering and ingesting raw source files for the slipbox. 

- This includes functionality like:
  - Recursively crawling folders
  - Identifying supported file types
  - Extracting text and metadata
  - Saving extracted information

Functionality:

- crawlDirectories(rootFolder)
  - Recursively crawls the folder structure starting from the provided root folder
  - Uses os.walk() to traverse folders
  - Yields path of each file found

- isSupportedFile(filepath)
  - Checks the file extension against a list of supported types
  - Returns True if the file can be processed, False otherwise

- extractText(filepath)
  - Based on file type, extracts raw text 
  - PDF -> PDF parser library
  - DOC -> text extraction library 
  - Plain text -> just read file contents

- extractMetadata(filepath)
  - Extract metadata like title, author, date if possible
  - PDFs may have embedded metadata for example

- importFile(filepath, extractedText, metadata)
  - Saves the extracted information as an ImportFile model

Implementation:

- The InputFileManager could be initialized with the root folder to crawl
- It would expose public methods like crawl() and processFile()
- crawl() would initiate recursive folder traversal 
- processFile() would check the file type, extract text/metadata, and import

This would encapsulate all raw file handling and extraction in a reusable class. The higher level SlipBoxManager could create an InputFileManager and leverage it to populate initial source material for the slipbox.
