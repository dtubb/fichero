Here are some details on potential file handling classes and where they could be stored:

File Handling Classes:

- FileManager - Top level file operations class

- FileReader - Handles reading different file types into memory

- FileWriter - Handles writing in-memory objects to files

- MarkdownFileReader - Reads .md files into Slip objects

- BibTeXFileReader - Reads .bib files into Reference objects

Location:

- These classes could live in a new `src/slipbox/io` module. 

- Keeps file handling separated from core logic.

FileManager:

- Orchestrates all file system interactions

- Methods like:
  - readSlipFiles() - loop through slip folder, read each
  - writeSlip() - write one Slip object to .md file

FileReader:

- Abstract base class defining interface for reading files to objects

MarkdownFileReader:

- Extends FileReader
- Implements read() to parse Markdown into Slip objects

BibTeXFileReader:

- Extends FileReader
- Implements read() to parse BibTeX into Reference objects

FileWriter:

- Abstract base class defining interface for writing objects to files

- WriteSlipFile, WriteBibTeXFile extend and implement for specific file types

This provides a clean architecture for handling file reading and writing. The higher level SlipBoxManager can call FileManager to load or save the overall state.
