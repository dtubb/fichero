To start running, a structured approach is key. Invest in a quality pair of running shoes to minimize the risk of injury[^1]. Beginners can adopt the run/walk method, starting with 1 minute of running followed by 2 minutes of walking, repeating for 20-30 minutes[^2]. Gradually increase the running intervals as your endurance improves. A structured program like Couch to 5K can guide new runners through this progression[^3]. Proper running form involves maintaining an upright posture, relaxed shoulders, and landing with your foot beneath your hip[^4]. Rest days are essential for recovery; beginners should start with running three times a week and adjust based on how their body responds[^5]. Dynamic stretches before and static stretches after running are important for injury prevention[^6]. Stay hydrated and consider using a running app to track your progress. Listen to your body to avoid overexertion, and ensure nutrition supports your running plan.
