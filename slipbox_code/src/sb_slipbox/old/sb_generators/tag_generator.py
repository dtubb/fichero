# src/sb_slipbox/sb_generators/tag_generator.py

"""Generate tags for slips."""

"""  
The key aspects:

Uses NLTK for POS tagging and noun phrase extraction
Extracts noun phrases from all slips
Counts frequency of each phrase
Creates Tag objects with phrase and count
This allows automatically generating tags based on the content of the slips.

Some ways to improve:

Use more advanced NLP for extraction
Filter phrases by length, stopwords, etc
Support manual tags in addition to generated ones
Use TF-IDF or other scoring instead of just frequency
Return tags ranked by importance rather than just count
Let me know if you would like me to expand the documentation or modify the implementation!
