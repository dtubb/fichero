0. augment rather than automate.
1. summary of summaries approach compounds selection bias. How to avoid this? Retain relations of the parts to the whole, reference the whole at each step.
2. extract while abstracting (adds citation bias, but retains original specific text and the basis for generalization)
3. interpretable generalization at each level (case,box,collection)
4. calculate entity frequency and most significant topics at each level
5. keep this information in an image-, doc-, and box-level summary card ((Resource Record)).
6. use the summary cards to generate the collection-level summary


at image level
llm_catalogue is image-level summary 
folder_summary is doc-level summary

i can store cards in chromadb, but not update them like mongo

problem with RAG approach is that it is not interpretable.
chunks are selected given similarity, not relevance to the whole or distinctiveness of the part.

#need box and collection level summary 




approach as a ml task, how to optimize for higher-level generalizations that are summaries of the lower-level generalizations. answer: 
a human would create cards, carry information forward up the hierarchy, and generate a collection-level summary.
